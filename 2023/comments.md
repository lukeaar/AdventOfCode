# Day 1
Part two threw a spanner in the works with substrings like "eightwo" which ended up requiring a hacky solution.
# Day 2
Easy day today.
# Day 3
I initially got caught by an edge case that wasn't present in the test data - a part number against the right-hand edge of the engine schematic. Interestingly, this would have been easily handled by my initial plan of padding the schematic with a border of '.' characters to avoid having to handle the edge cases, but I think in general an approach which avoids editing the input data is preferred for Advent of Code problems.
